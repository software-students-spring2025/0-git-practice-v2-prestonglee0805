## Analysis:  
The article dives into an analysis on **DeepSeek**, an open source AI company developing LLMS. The most interesting aspect of this article is how it speaks on the involvement of Chinese censorship within the model, speaking on a "bias" that the model has. The engineers have likely trained and restricted certain keywords for the model to not give answers to, specifically in the context of Chinese governmental jurisdiction over Taiwan, and any speech against the leadership of Xi Jinping. A major issue that arises from US citizen usage of Deepseek is that this can unknowingly push Chinese ideologies to American and foreign citizens, resulting in a loss of trust in the U.S. government. Beyond this, the collapse in the technology market after the introduction of the DeepSeek AI model showed the immense power that can be generated from technology on minimal funding, only 6 million dollars, drastically rivaling the funding of U.S. AI efforts spending hundreds of billions of dollars on AI progression. The project is also open source, allowing for anyone to gain access to the source code of the LLM, a huge step forward for public access to advanced AI models.
